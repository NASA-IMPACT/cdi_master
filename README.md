# cdi_master
Master list of all datasets in the CDI.

This master list holds all of the pertinent information about the CDI datasets on data.gov/climate and 
the geospatial subset on GeoPlatform's Resilience community. As information changes, updating URL's and ID's are very important. 
This list is referenced by the "CDI_master_tool.py" found here: https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/DCD-Tool

The code checks for active and inactive URLS and identifies datasets that have fallen out of the collection. 

The code "resilience_QA" is used to check the resilience portfolio against the master list to check for datasets that do not align with the master list. This can be because the ID was recorded wrongly, there were duplicates of the dataset, or the dataset was updated without being edited from the old version.

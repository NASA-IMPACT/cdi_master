# cdi_master
master list of all datasets in the CDI
This master list holds all of the pertinent information about the CDI datasets on data.gov/climate and 
the geospatial subset on GeoPlatform's Resilience community. As information changes, updating URL's and ID's are very important. 
This list is referenced by the "CDI_master_tool.py" on Patrick Staton's github. https://github.com/jr0020/DCD-Tool
The code checks for active and inactive URLS and identifies datasets that have fallen out of the collection. For future use and questions
, please contact Kane Cook at fkcook12@gmail.com

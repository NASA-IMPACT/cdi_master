# cdi_master
Master list of all datasets in the CDI collection (i.e. datasets identified during the Climate Data Initiative (CDI) to be included in the Climate collection on Data.gov). 
This master list holds all of the pertinent information about the datasets in data.gov/climate and 
the geospatial subset in GeoPlatform's Resilience community. As information changes, updating URLs and IDs are very important. 
This list is referenced by "CDI_master_tool.py" in the following IMPACT repo: https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/DCD-Tool
The DCD-Tool checks for active and inactive URLS and identifies datasets that have fallen out of the climate collection. 

The code "resilience_QA" is used to check the Resilience Community portfolio against the CDI master list to check for datasets that do not align with the master list. Reasons for discrepancies include: the ID was wrongly recorded, there are duplicates of the dataset, the dataset was updated without being edited from the old version.
